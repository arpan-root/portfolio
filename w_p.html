            <h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, the Trello clone frontend development project provided valuable insights into modern frontend technologies and practices. It successfully achieved the objectives of creating a responsive and user-friendly interface similar to Trello, practicing JavaScript DOM manipulation, and implementing drag-and-drop functionality. The project's scope was limited to frontend development, excluding backend functionalities such as server-side logic, database integration, and API development. This project enhanced my skills in frontend architecture, design principles, and interactive user interface development. Moving forward, I look forward to applying these learnings in future projects to create more sophisticated and interactive web applications.</p>
